# OIBSIP

## One month summer Internship tasks from Oasis Infobyte on `Data Science`

## Task 1:

- Iris Classification:
  - Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
    measurements. Assuming we have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
    their species, and the task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
    measurements of the iris species and classify them.

## Task 2:

- Car Price Prediction: - Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
  who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
  increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so we are going to analyze the unemployment rate.

## Task 3:

- Sales prediction: - Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
  such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
  advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
  Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
  their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
  product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76813100/233343911-a915b4a5-dfa2-4b08-a20e-6af5eb6e8353.png)
